## Dialogs
### Share Dialog
The Share dialog works by making a one-line call to the SDK that configures the content to share, does an app switch to the native Facebook for iOS app, and returns to your app once people have shared. The Share Dialog requires that the user has the native Facebook for iOS app installed on their device.
